-----------

We do not create models in FrontController because models are out of reach. They are part of the application logic and
we do not know nothing about it.

xenFramework made by programmers for programmers
xenFramework is what it was expected for zf to be to a programmer
easy to learn, easy to use, intuitive, fast, no magic methods, no globals, no singletons, ...
NO MAGIC => everything is under your control, EXPLICIT

i.e. you can render a view from any controller
